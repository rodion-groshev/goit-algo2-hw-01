## Task 1. Find the maximum and minimum elements

> Implement a function that finds the maximum and minimum elements in an array using the divide and conquer method.

-    The function accepts an array of numbers of arbitrary length.
-    A recursive approach is used.
-    A tuple of values (minimum, maximum) is returned.
-    The complexity of the algorithm is O(n).


## Task 2. Find the k-th smallest element

> Implement an algorithm for finding the k-th smallest element in an unsorted array using the Quick Select principle.

-   The function must accept an array of numbers and the number k.
-   You must use the approach with the selection of the pivot element .
-    The array should not be completely sorted.
-    The expected complexity in the average case should be O(n).
